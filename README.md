# Travel-Brochure_OIBSIP
(Task 5)

I've used Canva software to build the assigned task.
I've made this on Indian theme, emphasising on India travel.
Have given a brief intro about the tour and travel company.
Have added dummy contact number, email id, address and website with proper representative icons. Added graphics of Hawa Mahal, India Gate, Meenakshi Temple, Lotus Temple, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Red Fort, Charminar and various other travel related graphics to give it a professional and attractive look.
I've added what the travel company offers on the second page.
As a part of the representation, I've added both the pages in a single canvas and applied drop shadow effect for highlighted upliftment on the canvas.
